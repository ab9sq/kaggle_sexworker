Content
The database includes data scraped from a European online adult forum. Using covert online ethnography 
we interviewed a small number of participants and determined their risk to either supply or demand sex 
services through that forum. This is a great dataset for semi-supervised learning.

Inspiration
How can we identify individuals at risk of being drawn into online sex work? The spread of online social 
media enables a greater number of people to be involved into online sex trade; however, detecting deviant
behaviors online is limited by the low available of data. To overcome this challenge, we combine covert o
nline ethnography with semi-supervised learning using data from a popular European adult forum.
